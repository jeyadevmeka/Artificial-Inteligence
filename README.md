# Artificial-Inteligence
This project is a two-player Halma board game where one player is controlled by an AI using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm and the other by a human. The game features a graphical interface built with pygame. The objective is to strategically move all pieces from the starting corner to the opposite corner before the opponent does.
